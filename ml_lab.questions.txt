Lab Questions
=======================
1. val it = [4,2,5,2,6,10] : int list

2. Function f uses recursion to add 1 to each element of the list that is input into the function.
   If the list is empty, it just returns an empty list.

3. a if the list is empty, the empty list is returned

4. b if the list is not empty, 1 is added to every value in the list

5. Question 5: false

6. Head recursion, because the recursive call is not the last thing the function
   does.

7. Question 7: { best times, it was the worst of times }

8. A function is considered to be tail recursive if the recursive call is the
   last thing done by the function. Tail recursion functions can be optimized
   more by the compiler through tail call elimination because the recursive call is the last statement in the
   function so there is nothing left in that instance of the function to keep
   track of.

9. Question 9: { and eggs green ham }

10. Question 10: { macaroni and }

11. I like that when you run a program in the command line you can dynamically
    test the program with any variables you create there. This makes testing easy
    as opposed to making changes in the code and compiling the program each time
    to test something.
